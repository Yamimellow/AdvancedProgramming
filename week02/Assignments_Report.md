#Assignments Submitted - Week 2
This is a report of your mistakes and correct points you did in your assignments , each with the Code Name assigned to each of you. 


##Common Mistakes :
``` 
int sum; // sum is int 
float avg = sum / 100; // int / int will result an int
//so throwing away the decimals.
```

	- Calculating total tax ?
	- forgot to calculate service costs
	- very bad looking code :D

- How lucky is your computer
	- the initialization of random generator 100 times is costly. ( Random r = new Random() can be used once )

##Crossfire
###+ve points :
- Restaurant Cal:
	- the use of for loop.

###-ve Points:
- Restaurant Cal:
	- the tax is a % of the meal not a constant .
	- the service and tips are the ones to be divided by 4

- How lucky is your computer
	- the division by int.
	- average thought of as an int. - average is a result of a division , and its probably a fraction never an int.
	- Lucky number not attached.

- Forgot Ctrl + f5 , to make the console wait and not close after finishing the program.
-  Email not attached.


##Aftermath
###+Ve Points:

- Restaurant Cal:
	- Use of class to encapsulate.
	- use of arrays
	- use of arrays of objects
	- use of methods.

- How lucky is your computer:
	- the use of array. though its useless. - you already calculate the sum by addition to the variable , no need to save the numbers in this programs.
	- correctly divided the average using 100f .


###-Ve Points:

- Restaurant Cal:
	- uninitialized objects in an array - thats a tough one it's missed by pros sometimes :D

    - the {0} formating in console.writeline

###-Ve Points:
- How Lucky is your computer :
    - initialization inside the loop totaly wrong.
    - there isn't even a division , use of % is very illogical. - and even calling it a pressing mistake makes it worse , you need to check your code and run it.

    - The Use of 2 dimensional arrays.

    - didn't print names instead of person[0] , since i read the names , its only logical that i will print them in the end.1

- How lucky is your computer:
    - division by int , though defined as a float.
    - the use of useless var x.
    - surprised when the % change every time. - it is supposed to be random  , its only logical that it changes every time , if it didn't it would be wrong.
    - the need to initialize sum to 0;
