#Assignments Submited - Week 2
This is a report of your mistakes and correct points you did in your assignments , each with the Code Name assigned to each of you. 


##Common Mistakes :
``` 
int sum; // sum is int 
float avg = sum / 100; // int / int will result an int
//so throwing away the decimals.
```


##Glyph
####+Ve Points
- Resturant Cal : 
	- Use of arrays.
	- Good use of for loop in the end calculaton.

- Followed the rules of submition correctly.

###-Ve Points
- Resturant Cal :
	- Didn't read meal name.
	- Didn't read tax %.
- How lucky is your computer : 
	- Division by int.

##Turbine
###-Ve Points :
- no assignment was submited at all . two usless files.
- didn't even look at the submisson rules.
- forgot to put in his email.




##Jetison
###+Ve Points:

- Resturant Cal:
	- customized tip is a pluse - though illogical.
	- calculating total cost for all - also usless its the thing written on the reciept already :) 
	- the use of writeline,readline to halt the program.

- How lucky is your computer:
	- the use of writeline,readline to halt the program.

###-Ve Points:
- Resturant Cal:
	- The Hard coded tax % , you should have read it , its diffrent from one resturant to another.
	- customized tip is a pluse - though illogical.
	- Calculating total tax ?
	- forgot to calculate service costs
	- very bad looking code :D

- How lucky is your computer
	- the initialization of random generator 100 times is costly. ( Random r = new Random() can be used once )
	- the division by int even though saving to data type float.
	- Lucky number not attached.

- didn't follow the rules of assignment folder naming.


##Crossfire
###+ve points :
- Resturant Cal:
	- the use of for loop.

###-ve Points:
- Resturant Cal:
	- the tax is a % of the meal not a constant .
	- the service and tips are the ones to be divided by 4

- How lucky is your computer
	- the division by int.
	- average thought of as an int. - average is a result of a division , and its probably a fraction never an int.
	- Lucky number not attached.

- Forgot Ctrl + f5 , to make the console wait and not close after finishing the program.
-  Email not attached.


##Aftermath
###+Ve Points:

- Resturant Cal:
	- Use of class to encapsulate.
	- use of arrays
	- use of arrays of objects
	- use of methods.

- How lucky is your computer:
	- the use of array. though its useless. - you already calculate the sum by addition to the variable , no need to save the numbers in this programs.
	- correctly divided the average using 100f .


###-Ve Points:

- Resturant Cal:
	- uninitialized objects in an array - thats a tough one its missed by pros some times :D
	- Doesn't print total costs.
	- forgot to read tips

- How lucky is your computer
	- the initialization of random generator 100 times is costly.  ( Random r = new Random() can be used once )
	- the use of array is useless.
	- Lucky number not attached.

- Didn't follow the rules of submission.


##Monarch 
###+Ve Points:

###-Ve Points:
- How lucky is your Computer:
	- division by int problem.

- Results not submited
- other assignment isn't submited.
- didn't follow the rules of assignment folder naming.

##Dryad 

###+Ve Points:
- How lucky is your computer
    - the {0} formating in console.writeline

###-Ve Points:
- How Lucky is your computer :
    - initicalization insidee the loop totaly wrong.
    - there isn't even a division , use of % is very illogical. - and even calling it a pressing mistake makes it worse , you need to check your code and run it.

- Only one assignment submited.
- Assignment rules not followed.


##Torrent
###+Ve Points:
- Resturant Cal:
    - The Use of 2 dimintonal arrays.
    - correct equation for total cost.
- submission rules are followed correctly.
- attached results.


###-Ve Points:
- Resturant Cal:
    - Reading cost before names is illogical.
    - Code doesn't Work.
    - Wierd project structure. - folders inside folders.
    - Not parsing Cost,tax,service. - couldnt use parse even after reading the codes.
    - didn't print names insetd of person[0] , since i read the names , its only logical that i will print them in the end.1
    - costs are only 3 while 4 persons.
    
- How lucky is your computer:
    - division by int , though defined as a float.
    - the use of usless var x.
    - surprized when the % change every time. - it is supposed to be random  , its only logical that it changes every time , if it didn't it would be wrong.
    - the need to initialize sum to 0;


##Ball Lightning

###-Ve Points
- Resturant Cal:
    - The code looks bad 
    - printing what was just inputed.
    - The application doesn't do anything ! just reads and prints what it read.

    -  use of classes
    -  correct equation
- How Lucky is your computer:
    - Division by float 

###-Ve Points

    - class members are private
    - setters return ! which is wrong.
